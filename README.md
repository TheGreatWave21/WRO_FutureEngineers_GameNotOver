# The car

Our robot consists of two main parts. The electronics and the chassis. --to be continued

## Components

This list contains all the materials that were used to build our Robot. This includes everything (except 3D-printed parts, which are not included here. More about them later):
1. Arduino Potenta H7
2. Gens ace Modellbau-Akkupack (LiPo) 11.1 V 1200 mAh Zellen-Zahl: 3 25 C Block
3. Motraxx SR540SH-6230S-67 Universal Brushed Elektromotor
4. Cytron MD10C

You can see the base in the 3D printer.

You can see the unfinished base without the "sticks", which are going to give stability to the whole vehicle and hold our control system. (arduino potenta)

![Design software](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19326527/IMG_5108.pdf)

Here you can see the robot in the 3D printing design software. This part will only be used for the base.
